Interactive Portfolio Website with JS, C++, Animation, and Free AI Integration

Layout Structure and Navigation
Begin with a clean, single-page design (built in React) where a fixed navbar anchors each section (Home, Story, Projects, AI, Contact). Use TailwindCSS to create responsive layouts (flex/grid utilities, breakpoints, dark mode toggle). At the very top, display your name/logo and a succinct tagline to brand yourself. Include a prominent “Contact” or “Resume” call-to-action button so recruiters can easily email you or download your CV

. Consider a floating or sticky contact widget (or chat icon) so contact info is never far away. As a guideline, the “basic formula” of a portfolio includes a logo, tagline, featured work, and contact info

. Tailor the site to your journey: for example, you could feature a “Technical Skills” or “About Me” anchor, but avoid bullet-list resumes – instead humanize it with narrative text or a timeline (see Storytelling below).
Use React Router (or anchor links) for smooth scrolling between sections. Ensure mobile-friendly menus (hamburger for small screens).
Highlight branding: your name/logo on every page and in the title, plus a matching color scheme. This reinforces identity at each viewport.
Provide contact/resume links in multiple places: a top Navbar button, a footer, and/or a side-floating element. 

Interactive Storytelling & Animations
Use GSAP and Lottie to turn your life story into an engaging, scroll-driven timeline. Instead of static text lists, show key stages (“Gaming”, “Cheat-Engine Hobby”, “Phishing Research”, “Web Curiosity”, “MSc (CIT)”, “Full-Stack Dev”) as successive scenes. For example:
GSAP ScrollTimeline: As the user scrolls, trigger GSAP timeline animations that reveal each life stage (fade-ins, parallax, or vector graphics). GSAP’s powerful Timeline feature is ideal for interactive storytelling
blog.pixelfreestudio.com
. For instance, pin a vertical timeline and animate icons or short text snippets at each stop (a game controller icon for “Gaming”, an email icon for “Phishing”, a university hat for “MSc”, etc.). The timeline format makes your journey scannable and personal

Lottie Animations: Sprinkle lightweight Lottie JSON animations to bring flair (e.g. a subtle pixelated game loop, a cursor exploring a webpage, or a spinning globe for “learning” stages). Lottie animations (exported from After Effects) run smoothly and encourage scrolling engagement
lottiefiles.com
. For example, an animated mouse pointer inviting “Scroll” or a pixel-art animation can add a fun gaming vibe Keep animations subtle and relevant so they complement (not overwhelm) your story.
Performance & Accessibility: Don’t animate every element. Prioritize content and defer complex animations off-screen. Test on real devices (desktop and mobile) to ensure smooth performance

. Honor user preferences: use CSS @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) to disable non-critical animations for motion-sensitive users

Project Showcase and Case Studies
Dedicate a section to your key projects (central auth system, billing app, college websites, etc.). Lead with visual thumbnails or screenshots: a grid or carousel where each project’s image draws the eye. Recruiters form first impressions on visuals
kinsta.com
, so use crisp screenshots or short GIFs. For example, have cards with a project title and tech stack on hover. Clicking a project should open more detail or a live link.
Full-Stack Projects (React/Node): Include at least one substantial full-stack app using your primary stack (React/Tailwind + Node/Express + MySQL). Projects built with modern tech are in high demand
nucamp.co
. For instance, showcase your centralized auth system and billing app with links to live demos or GitHub. Highlight these as “anchor projects” that solve real problems
nucamp.co
.
Concise Descriptions: Under each thumbnail or in a modal, briefly explain the problem, your approach, and technologies used. Use bullet points or short paragraphs. As Kinsta notes, visitors first see visuals, so pair every image with a headline and a blurb
kinsta.com
. For example: “Company Billing App: A React/Node web app with Stripe integration for automated invoicing (built at Xtown Co.). Technologies: React, Express, MySQL, Docker.”
Case Study Callouts: If space allows, turn one or two projects into mini case studies. List the purpose, your role, key challenges, and impact/outcome (metrics or user feedback). Kinsta recommends case studies to show process and results
kinsta.com
. E.g. “Added multi-user support to the billing app, reducing invoice errors by 30%.” This depth demonstrates problem-solving beyond the finished UI.
Live Links and Code: For each project, include a “View Live” and/or “View Code” link. This could be a small icon or button. If possible, embed a GitHub icon with your repo. (Even if GitHub contributions are implied, making it easy to click shows transparency.)
C++/WebAssembly Demo (Tech Deep Dive)
If you want to highlight your C++ skills, embed a small C++ → WebAssembly interactive demo. For example, create a math puzzle, an algorithm visualizer, or a simple game (like Tic-Tac-Toe or a bouncing balls animation). Compile it with Emscripten and load it in a React component. WebAssembly allows C/C++ code to run in the browser at near-native speed
medium.com
, which impresses tech-savvy recruiters.
Why WebAssembly: As one tutorial notes, WASM offers a “sizable performance increase for data-heavy applications, and opens the browser up to C/C++”
medium.com
. In practice, this means a C++ simulation or graphics demo feels smooth.
Example Projects: You could implement a simple physics demo (e.g. bouncing balls) or maze generator in C++. (The Twr-wasm examples include C++ demos like bouncing balls and a Pong game
twiddlingbits.dev
 – these illustrate the kind of interactivity you can achieve.) A coded math tool is also neat: for instance, a live fractal generator or Fourier transform visualizer using C++ math libraries, compiled to WASM.
Integration: Write your C++ logic (e.g. in module.cpp), compile it with emcc (as in
medium.com
), and then load it via the generated JS/WASM in your React app. You can wrap it in a <canvas> or <div> and animate with requestAnimationFrame. Even a small demo (like drawing moving particles) conveys “systems skills + performance optimization.” Include a note like “Demonstration implemented in C++ → WebAssembly” in the caption.

AI-Powered Interactive Feature

Copilot-Style Demo: As an alternative to a chatbot, embed a small AI code assistant. For example, use a CodeMirror or Monaco editor instance and integrate the GitHub Copilot API (if you can get temporary access) or a free code-completion model. Let recruiters try typing a comment or code and see a suggestion pop up. Even simulating this with a simple prompt (e.g. “Type a function name… get a stub”) highlights your interest in AI tools.
Other Ideas: You could also embed a semantic search of your blog or projects using an embedding API (demonstrating vector search) or a small “AI search” widget. The goal is simply to have some interactive AI element. (It sends the message: “This developer experiments with cutting-edge tech.”)
Additional Creative Features and Polish

About/Story Section: Besides timeline, write an About Me blurb that weaves in your history (as ElegantThemes suggests) rather than dry bullets
elegantthemes.com
. A chronological narrative (or a brief video/animation) makes you more memorable than a plain CV.
Testimonials or Endorsements: If possible, add a rotating testimonial or quote from a manager or peer. Seeing “X says this person improved our system’s performance by 50%” adds credibility. As Kinsta notes, testimonials let others tout your skills and can sway visitors

.
Dark Mode Toggle: Add a theme switcher (light/dark) with Tailwind’s dark: classes. It’s a small feature, but it shows attention to user preference.
Performance & SEO: Optimize images and Lottie files for fast load. Use React’s lazy loading and Tailwind’s JIT mode. Include meta tags (title/description) and a simple blog or news section if you enjoy writing; blogging about your projects not only shows communication skills but also boosts SEO


Easter Eggs or Interactive Touches: Tech recruiters love clever details. For instance, an “Inspect Element” console message, a hidden game triggered by a keypress, or animated confetti when a project card is clicked. These aren’t required, but they make the experience fun and memorable.
Throughout the site, follow good UI/UX: keep paragraphs short, use headers, list skills, and ensure color contrast and legibility. As one expert said, “Good design is good business” – a polished, thoughtfully structured portfolio will reflect well on your skills




1. Prepare Your Live2D Model
Create or commission a Live2D model (a .model3.json plus associated .moc3, texture, and motion files). You can design one in Live2D Cubism or hire an artist on platforms like Fiverr.

Export the model into a folder inside your Next.js public/ directory, e.g. public/live2d/avatar.model3.json and its assets in public/live2d/assets/.

2. Install & Import Sora
Add the Pixi-Live2D Sora package:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install pixi-live2d-sora pixi.js
Or with yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn add pixi-live2d-sora pixi.js
3. Create a React Component for Your Avatar
In components/Live2DAvatar.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
'use client';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { Live2DModel } from 'pixi-live2d-sora';

export default function Live2DAvatar() {
  const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!canvasRef.current) return;

    // Initialize Pixi Application
    const app = new PIXI.Application({
      view: canvasRef.current,
      backgroundAlpha: 0,
      resolution: window.devicePixelRatio || 1,
      autoDensity: true,
      width: 300,
      height: 400,
    });

    // Load and add the Live2D model
    Live2DModel.from(
      'live2d/avatar.model3.json',            // path under public/
      { autoInteract: true }                  // lets the model follow your cursor
    ).then((model) => {
      model.scale.set(0.4);                   // adjust size
      model.x = app.renderer.width / 2;
      model.y = app.renderer.height;
      app.stage.addChild(model);
    });

    return () => {
      app.destroy(true, { children: true });
    };
  }, []);

  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
}
4. Embed the Component in Your Page
In pages/index.tsx (or wherever you want it):


import Live2DAvatar from '@/components/Live2DAvatar';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center p-8">
      {/* …other sections… */}
      <section id="about" className="my-16">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
        {/* Place the avatar to one side */}
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Live2DAvatar />
          <p className="ml-8 max-w-lg">
            {/* Your animated-story text here */}
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      {/* …other sections… */}
    </main>
  );
}
Tailwind classes will help you position it nicely—e.g. w-72 h-96 on the canvas container to control size.

5. Customize Interactions & Animations
Auto-interaction: { autoInteract: true } makes the avatar follow the cursor.

Motions: You can trigger different motions (e.g. wave, blink) by calling model.motion('wave') on click or on scroll events.

Position & Scale: Tweak model.scale.set(...), model.x, and model.y to fit your layout.
