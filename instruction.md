C++/WebAssembly Demo (Tech Deep Dive)
If you want to highlight your C++ skills, embed a small C++ → WebAssembly interactive demo. For example, create a math puzzle, an algorithm visualizer, or a simple game (like Tic-Tac-Toe or a bouncing balls animation). Compile it with Emscripten and load it in a React component. WebAssembly allows C/C++ code to run in the browser at near-native speed

, which impresses tech-savvy recruiters.
Why WebAssembly: As one tutorial notes, WASM offers a “sizable performance increase for data-heavy applications, and opens the browser up to C/C++”


AI-Powered Interactive Feature

Copilot-Style Demo: As an alternative to a chatbot, embed a small AI code assistant. For example, use a CodeMirror or Monaco editor instance and integrate the GitHub Copilot API (if you can get temporary access) or a free code-completion model. Let recruiters try typing a comment or code and see a suggestion pop up. Even simulating this with a simple prompt (e.g. “Type a function name… get a stub”) highlights your interest in AI tools.
Other Ideas: You could also embed a semantic search of your blog or projects using an embedding API (demonstrating vector search) or a small “AI search” widget. The goal is simply to have some interactive AI element. (It sends the message: “This developer experiments with cutting-edge tech.”)
Additional Creative Features and Polish

About/Story Section: Besides timeline, write an About Me blurb that weaves in your history (as ElegantThemes suggests) rather than dry bullets
elegantthemes.com
. A chronological narrative (or a brief video/animation) makes you more memorable than a plain CV.
Testimonials or Endorsements: If possible, add a rotating testimonial or quote from a manager or peer. Seeing “X says this person improved our system’s performance by 50%” adds credibility. As Kinsta notes, testimonials let others tout your skills and can sway visitors

.
Dark Mode Toggle: Add a theme switcher (light/dark) with Tailwind’s dark: classes. It’s a small feature, but it shows attention to user preference.
Performance & SEO: Optimize images and Lottie files for fast load. Use React’s lazy loading and Tailwind’s JIT mode. Include meta tags (title/description) and a simple blog or news section if you enjoy writing; blogging about your projects not only shows communication skills but also boosts SEO


Easter Eggs or Interactive Touches: Tech recruiters love clever details. For instance, an “Inspect Element” console message, a hidden game triggered by a keypress, or animated confetti when a project card is clicked. These aren’t required, but they make the experience fun and memorable.
Throughout the site, follow good UI/UX: keep paragraphs short, use headers, list skills, and ensure color contrast and legibility. As one expert said, “Good design is good business” – a polished, thoughtfully structured portfolio will reflect well on your skills




1. Prepare Your Live2D Model
Create  a Live2D model (a .model3.json plus associated .moc3, texture, and motion files). You can design one in Live2D Cubism .

Export the model into a folder inside your Next.js public/ directory, e.g. public/live2d/avatar.model3.json and its assets in public/live2d/assets/.

2. Install & Import Sora
Add the Pixi-Live2D Sora package:

npm install pixi-live2d-sora pixi.js

3. Create a React Component for Your Avatar
In components/Live2DAvatar.tsx:


'use client';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { Live2DModel } from 'pixi-live2d-sora';

export default function Live2DAvatar() {
  const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!canvasRef.current) return;

    // Initialize Pixi Application
    const app = new PIXI.Application({
      view: canvasRef.current,
      backgroundAlpha: 0,
      resolution: window.devicePixelRatio || 1,
      autoDensity: true,
      width: 300,
      height: 400,
    });

    // Load and add the Live2D model
    Live2DModel.from(
      'live2d/avatar.model3.json',            // path under public/
      { autoInteract: true }                  // lets the model follow your cursor
    ).then((model) => {
      model.scale.set(0.4);                   // adjust size
      model.x = app.renderer.width / 2;
      model.y = app.renderer.height;
      app.stage.addChild(model);
    });

    return () => {
      app.destroy(true, { children: true });
    };
  }, []);

  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
}
4. Embed the Component in Your Page
In pages/index.tsx (or wherever you want it):


import Live2DAvatar from '@/components/Live2DAvatar';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center p-8">
      {/* …other sections… */}
      <section id="about" className="my-16">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
        {/* Place the avatar to one side */}
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Live2DAvatar />
          <p className="ml-8 max-w-lg">
            {/* Your animated-story text here */}
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      {/* …other sections… */}
    </main>
  );
}
Tailwind classes will help you position it nicely—e.g. w-72 h-96 on the canvas container to control size.

5. Customize Interactions & Animations
Auto-interaction: { autoInteract: true } makes the avatar follow the cursor.

Motions: You can trigger different motions (e.g. wave, blink) by calling model.motion('wave') on click or on scroll events.

Position & Scale: Tweak model.scale.set(...), model.x, and model.y to fit your layout.
